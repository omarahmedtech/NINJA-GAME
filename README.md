# NINJA-GAME
## Ninja Game Description
In this fast-paced action game, you take on the role of a heroic ninja. Your objective is to navigate through dangerous levels filled with enemies like spiders and dragons, while avoiding traps and using elevators to progress. Armed with limited health, the hero must carefully balance offense and defense to survive the relentless onslaught of enemies. You’ll also encounter challenging boss fights, such as the mighty dragon, which require quick reflexes and strategic gameplay to overcome.
# How to Play
### Movement:
The hero can move in multiple directions across the game grid. Movement is controlled by keyboard input (likely arrow keys or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`).

### Combat:
The hero can fire bullets at enemies like spiders and dragons by pressing the `b` key. Aim carefully and time your shots to defeat enemies while avoiding damage.

## Enemies:

### Spiders: 
Regular enemies that roam the levels. They can be shot with bullets.

### Dragon:
A boss-level enemy, requiring multiple shots to defeat.

### Spider Eggs:
These may spawn additional spiders or pose hazards to the player.

### Health System:
The hero has limited health. Each hit from an enemy reduces health, and the game ends if the hero's health reaches zero.

### Environment:
The game includes elevators, which allow the hero to travel between different levels or sections of the map. Use elevators strategically to reach higher or lower levels and avoid enemy encounters.
Laser Head: Lasers may be traps or obstacles that the player needs to avoid or deactivate.

### Objective:
The player’s goal is to clear levels by defeating enemies and bosses while avoiding traps, managing resources, using elevators to navigate through the environment, and surviving long enough to reach the end of the level.
